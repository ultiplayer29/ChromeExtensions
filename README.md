# ChromeExtensions
Basic chrome extension I built to augment the web filter already installed at the school I work at. This allows students to access the SFW portions of Reddit while blocking the NSFW portions, including individual posts on subreddits such as /r/all.

Initially looked into having a Tumblr portion to this, hence the code looking for Tumblr url's, but due to Tumblr's practice of having individual subdomains for each tumblr page it proved too difficult in the short term. Will revisit this summer most likely.
